Reps is Firefox DevTools' remote object formatter. It stands for *representation*.


## Example

```js
const React = require("react");
let { Rep, Grip } = require("devtools-modules");
Rep = React.createFactory(Rep);

function renderRep({ object, mode }) {
  return Rep({ object, defaultRep: Grip, mode });
}

ReactDOM.render(
  Rep({ object, defaultRep: Grip, mode }),
  document.createElement("div")
);
```

## Getting started

You need to clone the repository, then install dependencies, for which you'll need the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) tool:

```
git clone https://github.com/devtools-html/devtools-reps.git
cd devtools-reps
yarn install
```

*(Note: this should work with `npm` too, but there seems to be some [issues](https://github.com/devtools-html/devtools-reps/issues/75)).*

Once everything is installed, you can start the development server with:

```bash
yarn start
```

and navigate to ```http://localhost:8000``` to access the dashboard.
